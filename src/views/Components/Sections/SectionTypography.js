                text="Fire is more that just wood and flame. Fire has the power to unite, change and comfort us. There is a magical component to fire. It can make you fall in love, reminisce on special memories and feel inspired, all at the same time. You can sit in front of a fire for hours, hypnotized by its forgiving  flame content, of just being. One cannot describe the effect fire has on a basic human emotion in one word. It is one of the few basic human experiences that every person on the planet needs to experience. In some way or another it will change you, it will reconnect you on a much deeper level with yourself and others. For that basic principle we created this company with the intention of bringing you closer to nature the natural way whether you are cooking, staying warm or just wanting the experience."

                I will be the leader of a company that ends up being worth
                billions of dollars, because I got the answers. I understand
                culture. I am the nucleus. I think thatâ€™s a responsibility that
                I have, to push possibilities, to show people, this is the level
                that things could be at.
